mmcq.py -- Python implementation of Modified Median Color Quantization (MMCQ)
================================================================================

goal of this project is write `JS implemntation MMCQ`_ in python that supports processing multiple files with one
single command. It is forked from the repo https://github.com/admire93/mmcq.py.

Usage
--------

To get sample palette, you can use `mmcq.get_palette`.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from mmcq import get_palette
    >>> with get_palette(filename='/image/something.jpg', 3) as palette:
    ...     print palette
    [(255, 234, 0), (234, 245, 22), (42, 42, 42)]
    >>> from wand import Image
    >>> with Image(filename='/image/something.jpg') as image:
    ...     print get_palette(blob=image.make_blob(), 2)
    [(255, 234, 0), (234, 245, 22)]

To get dominant color, you can use `mmcq.get_dominant_color`
which color is frist of `mmcq.get_palette`.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from mmcq import get_dominant_color
   >>> get_dominant_color(filename='/image/something.jpg')
   (255, 234, 0)
